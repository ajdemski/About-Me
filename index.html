        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p><span>
          My name is Aaron Demski and im <strong>learning</strong> how to code
          using html and css. Also my favorite color is
          Blue! One of my big goals is to
          become a succesful dev and Epicodus has been a great help at making
          that come true. Big thanks to them! I also play a lot of video games
          and love building computers. Ive always wanted to become a race car
          driver since my family used to be big into racing. We even had our
          own racing team called Demski Racing. My dad was a the driver and my
          grandpa and him would work day and night 24/7 working on their race
          car getting it prepared for their next race. I have a big love for
          cars, some people may think that working day and night on a race car
          is ridiculous but its such a good feeling making something yourself
          and seeing what it looks like when its completed. Which is exactly
          what I hope to do with my coding skills!

        <h1>My Background</h1>
        <p>
          If you want to know more about my personal life I am a 21 year old
          junior developer who loves to code and wants to make a living out of
          it and hope to eventually work remotely and travel the world! I
          started Epicodus I had 0 coding experience and it was very difficult
          and different. Writing code and reading it and understanding it is
          completely different and both require a lot of practice to master.
          Im from Oregon and I have a golden retreiver named Marlee. I used to
          work with my dad and help out with his construction and remodeling
          business for awhile until I wanted to find somethingelse to do. Im
          very excited I started to code its changed my life completely.
